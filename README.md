Hello! Welcome to my connect-4 project.

There are two different implementations to consider: Rust and Python. Both have their own implementations of game itself (running in the terminal) and their own implementations of Monte Carlo Tree Search.

## Running Rust
See https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started for installation instructions. Once installed, run: `cargo r` to run the game (might need to run `cargo b` first).

## Running Python
Assuming python is installed (developed and testing using 3.8.6), the game canbe run with: `python mcts.py`
